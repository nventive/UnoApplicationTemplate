## Environment and Prerequisites

### Local Development Requirements
All development is expected to be done from Visual Studio in a Windows environment.

- .Net 7
- Visual Studio 2022 (17.4 and above)
  - We recommend validating your components using this [Uno guide](https://platform.uno/docs/articles/get-started-vs-2022.html).
- For mobile development, MAUI workloads are required.
  - You can install them using [`uno-check`](https://platform.uno/docs/articles/external/uno.check/doc/using-uno-check.html).
- For local iOS compilation and debugging, you need access to Mac with Xcode 14.2 (more recent versions may work too).

### Pipelines Requirements
The pipelines (for continuous integration, testing, and delivery) of this project are made for [Azure Pipelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started/what-is-azure-pipelines?view=azure-devops).

#### Required Knowledge
If you're unfamiliar with Azure Pipeline, you should at least read about the following topics.
- [Key Concepts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started/key-pipelines-concepts?view=azure-devops)
- [Set a secret variable in a variable group](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/set-secret-variables?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml%2Cbash#set-a-secret-variable-in-a-variable-group)
- [Add a secure file](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/library/secure-files?view=azure-devops#add-a-secure-file)

#### Required Infrastructure
- You need an Azure DevOps organization project with Pipelines enabled.
  - You can follow [this guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started/pipelines-sign-up?view=azure-devops) for more details.
- For compilation, access to the the following [Microsoft-hosted agents](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/hosted?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml) is required.
  - `windows-2022`
  - `macOS-13`
- For deployment, access to Mac agents with the following capabilities is required.
  - `fastlane 2.212.1`

## Repository Content

| Folder or File | Description |
|-:|-|
`.azuredevops/` | Used to store the pull request template used by Azure DevOps.
`build/` | Regroups all yaml files used that compose the pipelines defined in `.azure-pipelines.yml`.
`build/gitversion-config.yml` | Contains the configuration for the GitVersion tool that is used to compute the version number in the pipelines.
`.azure-pipelines.yml` | Defines the main CI/CD pipeline of the project.
`.azure-pipelines-canary.yml` | Defines the canary pipeline of the project.<br/>Canary pipelines allow to detect regressions by periodically creating versions of the app in which all the dependencies are updated to their latest version.
`doc/` | Regroups all the documentation of the project, with the only exception of `README.md`, which is located at the root of the repository.<br/><br/>**There are many topics covered. Make sure you check them out.**
`README.md` | The entry point of this project's documentation.
`src/` | Contains all the code of the application, including tests, with the exception of the configuration files located at the root of the repository.
`src/{YourProjectName}.sln` | The solution file to use with Visual Studio to develop locally.
`.editorconfig`<br/>& `stylecop.json` | Configure the code formatting rules and analyzers of Visual Studio.
`.gitignore` | Contains the git ignore rules.
`Directory.Build.props` | Regroups build configuration that apply to all `.csproj`.
`nuget.config` | Contains the configuration for NuGet packages.
`tools/` | Offers a place to put custom tools and scripts. It also contains some information about the version of the template that was used to generate the project.

## Software Architecture

The software architecture of the application is documented in the [Architecture.md](doc/Architecture.md) document.
It covers things like the application context, the functional overview, the application structure, the solution structure, the recipes, and more.

## Pipelines

This project uses Azure Pipelines to automate some processes.
They are described in details in [AzurePipelines.md](doc/AzurePipelines.md).
