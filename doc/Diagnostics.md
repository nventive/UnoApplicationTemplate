# Diagnostic Tools

This template comes with multiple built-in diagnostic tools.

## Diagnostics Overlay
When you start the application in debug, you'll notice a box on the side of the screen.
This overlay shows various counters and buttons.
The overlay is accessible from anywhere in your app.
This is useful when you want to see something happening live.
