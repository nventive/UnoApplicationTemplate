# Uno Platform Application Template

This is a mobile app project template using [Uno Platform](https://github.com/unoplatform/uno) and the latest .NET practices.

- It uses the MVVM pattern.
- Code is organized by [application layer](doc/Architecture.md#Solution-Structure).
- It comes with [dependency injection](doc/DependencyInjection.md).
- There are built-in [logs](doc/Logging.md) and [diagnostics tools](doc/Diagnostics.md).
- There is scaffolding code showing sample features.
  When you run as-is, you get a _Dad Jokes_ application.

## Getting Started

Bonjour! :D

We use `dotnet` project templates to easily create new projects. It simplifies the **project renaming** and supports **conditional inclusions**.

### Installing the template

1. In order to install the template, clone this repository on your machine, open a command prompt at its root, and run the following command

   `dotnet new -i ./`

    This will list you the list of installed templates, look for this template and copy the command with the absolute path like this. (Note the quotes added, otherwise it doesn't work)

    `dotnet new -u "C:\P\ApplicationTemplate"`

### Running the template to generate a new project

1. To run the template and create a new project, run the following command in the root folder that will contain the new project.

    `dotnet new nv-mobile -n MyProjectName`

    The following options are available when running the command.

    - To get help: `dotnet new nv-mobile -h`

[Read this for more information on custom templates](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/custom-templates).

### Uninstalling the template
1. If you want to uninstall the template, run the following command.

    `dotnet new -u ./`

## Requirements

This template largely relies on Uno Platform, if you want to make sure you got everything installed correctly on your machine, we encourage you to use `uno-check`, the documentation is available [here](https://platform.uno/docs/articles/uno-check.html)

In addition to that, **Visual Studio 2022 is required** since C# 10 is used.
